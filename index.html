        This was the beginning of my journey to learn to code. I began following a Unity 
        tutorial to make a vehicle drive down a road and allow the player to control it.

            This was a practice challenge given during the Unity Hub course. I was given some broken
            code and was required to fix it to ensure the player could control the plane and the camera
            would follow.

        After doing some work with C#, I realised how much I had enjoyed myself learning this new skill and I wanted to expand
        this knowledge and decided to begin learning HTML and CSS.
        <br>
        <br>
        I began watching YouTube tutorials and practising in Visual Studio Code, copying what was being shown in the videos.
        This covered the basics of HTML and how to add text, media, tables and other items. After learning these basics I branched to CSS,
        where I started to learn how to add style to my website.
